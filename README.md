# HeartSwitch

www.heartswitch.eu

HeartSwitch aims to build a completely intelligent home automation system based on signals from bracelets. As a goal, we refer mainly to nursing homes, hotels and hospitals, but also to solutions for private homes. 

This project has been tested using:
- Nodemcu v.3 (Wifi SoC ESP8266);
- MAX30100 or MAX30102 or MAX30105;
- OLED Display 1306;
- Blynk IoT App;

Support our mission on Kickstarter page and allow us to carry out this project. You will receive the exclusive home automation kit for the preview.
